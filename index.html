    <p>My Dearest Lorence,<br>
As I sit here and think of you, my heart swells with so much love that words barely seem enough to express how I feel.<br>
But still, I find myself compelled to try, hoping that in some way,<br>
these words will reach you the way my heart does every time I think of you.<br>
From the moment we met, something shifted in me.<br> 
I didn’t realize it then, but now I know—my life was forever changed.<br> 
You brought a light into my world that I never knew was missing, and in your presence, everything feels right.<br> 
It’s in the way you smile, the warmth of your voice, and the kindness you show the world.<br> 
You have a way of making the ordinary seem extraordinary, and my days are brighter simply because you’re in them.<br>
I cherish every little moment we share, every laugh, every conversation, and every quiet moment spent in each other’s company.<br> 
You’ve become my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest love.<br> 
There is no one else I would rather spend my time with than you.<br>
I want you to know that I am here for you, in every moment, through every challenge, and in all the joys that life brings.<br> 
My love for you is endless, a constant in a world that changes so quickly.<br> 
I am thankful for you every single day, and I cannot wait to continue writing our story together.<br>
With all my heart,<br>
-Sadness</p>
